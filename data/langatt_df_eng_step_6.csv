My husband learnt Greek first as a child, he was very fluent, he later learnt french at school and continued his high school studies in English. He is fluent in all 3 languages. He travels Greece every summer which allows him to practice and speak as much as he can with our surroundings in Canada. 

Even minimum exposure is advantageous to a person at a young age, as they can choose to reinforce it later on. A lack of exposure at a young age makes it very difficult to reinforce later on as they do not have the base. My mother speaks fluent Vietnamese as well, but I was not exposed, therefore with efforts it was still difficult to fully grasp. My Mandarin was easy to bring back.
